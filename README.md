# Surplus Food Management System

# Project Mission
The Nourishing Lives, One Meal at a Time initiative is focused on the efficient collection, tracking, and redistribution of surplus food exclusively from restaurants to individuals and organizations looking to address food insecurity. Our mission is to fight hunger, reduce the wasted food generated by the food service industry, and to raise a compassionate society. By using technology and collaboration, we ensure that the excess food in restaurants is quickly and systematically brought to those in need, providing a sustainable solution to hunger that is impactful.

# Problem Statement
Design and implement a software system to manage the collection, tracking, and redistribution of surplus food from restaurants to individuals and organizations working on addressing food insecurity with efficiency, traceability, and scalability.
